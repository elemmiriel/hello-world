Hello everyone!

I want to tell about myself. I'm Kate, Russian girl, who loves IT-world: computers, programming and videogames. I studied for an Information Security specialist in Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. But it was a great disappointment, 'cause I dreamed to be programmer, not IT-lawyer. So I decided to learn programming with web, books, courses etc. I learned C++/C# in Univercity, later I started Java but now I really fall in love with front-end. I will upload here my JavaScript projects and some HTML/CSS ideas.
